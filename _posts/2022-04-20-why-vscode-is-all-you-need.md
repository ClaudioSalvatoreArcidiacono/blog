I am a huge fan a VSCode. I use it almost for every single task I need to do: presentations, writing text documents, writing this blog and of course coding. VSCode by itself is good, but what makes it the best IDE for me are its *extensions* and the communities behind them.

In this post I am not going to talk about 
In this post I would like to share with you the extensions that I use the most and I will show you how VSCode can replace also Word and Powerpoint.
